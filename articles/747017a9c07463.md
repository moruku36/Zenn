Cloud native security is a holistic approach to securing cloud-based applications and infrastructure, from the operating system to the container to the application layer. Cloud native security seeks to ensure the same or higher conditions of diligence, integrity, trust, and threat prevention as traditional security models while integrating modern concepts of ephemerality, distribution, and immutability.

Some of the key topics covered in the event were:

- Cloud native security best practices and challenges
- Cloud native security projects and tools
- Cloud native security case studies and use cases
- Cloud native security trends and future directions   

Some of the highlights of the event were:

- A keynote by Liz Rice, VP of Open Source Engineering at Aqua Security, on the state of cloud native security and the role of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in fostering collaboration and innovation in this space.  

- A panel discussion on the cloud native security whitepaper, a collaborative effort by the CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Security (TAG-Security) to provide a comprehensive overview of cloud native security principles, challenges, and solutions.
